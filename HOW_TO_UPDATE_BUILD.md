# üöÄ How to Update Your Build - Complete Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Why Changes Aren't Visible

**Your code has all the fixes ‚úÖ BUT your build doesn't have them yet ‚ùå**

### Understanding the Problem:
- Code changes = Source code on your computer
- Build = Compiled app (APK/IPA) installed on device
- **Changes in code DON'T automatically appear in builds**
- You MUST create a NEW BUILD to see changes

---

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed in Code (Ready to Build)

All 6 issues are fixed in the code:

1. ‚úÖ App icon configured (local file, not URL)
2. ‚úÖ Notification icon configured
3. ‚úÖ File download fixed (FileSystem API)
4. ‚úÖ Duplicate notifications removed
5. ‚úÖ Smart notification routing added
6. ‚úÖ Authentication guard fixed

**Version: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1**
**Android versionCode: 2 ‚Üí 3**

## üéØ Step-by-Step: Create New Build

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
- [ ] EAS CLI installed: `npm install -g eas-cli`
- [ ] Logged into EAS: `eas login`
- [ ] Project linked: `eas init` (if not already)

### Step 1: Verify Configuration

Check that `app.json` has correct configuration:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "version": "1.0.1",  // ‚Üê Should be 1.0.1
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",  // ‚Üê Local file
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 3,  // ‚Üê Should be 3
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/images/icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#20606B"
      },
      "permissions": [
        "READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
        "WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
        "DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Build Development Version (Test First)

This creates a build you can install immediately to test:

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

**What happens:**
1. EAS uploads your code to cloud
2. Builds APK with all your changes
3. Provides download link
4. You download and install on device

**Time:** ~15-20 minutes

### Step 3: Install and Test

After build completes:

1. Click the download link EAS provides
2. Download APK to your device
3. Install the APK
4. Test all 6 fixes:
   - [ ] App icon shows OnCare logo
   - [ ] Notification icon shows OnCare logo
   - [ ] File download works
   - [ ] Only one notification in foreground
   - [ ] Click notification with "document" ‚Üí routes to Documents
   - [ ] App opens to login screen

### Step 4: Build Production Version

Once development build works:

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates optimized production build
2. Generates AAB file for Google Play Store
3. Ready for submission

**Time:** ~20-30 minutes

### Step 5: Submit to Google Play Store

```bash
eas submit -p android
```

**What happens:**
1. Uploads AAB to Google Play Console
2. Creates new release (version 1.0.1)
3. Users see update available

**Time:** ~5 minutes upload, ~1-7 days review

---

## üîÑ Update Strategy Options

### Option A: Internal Testing (Fastest)

**Best for:** Quick testing with team

1. Build production version:
```bash
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

2. In Google Play Console:
   - Go to **Testing ‚Üí Internal testing**
   - Click "Create new release"
   - Upload the AAB file
   - Add testers (email addresses)
   - Publish

3. Testers install via Google Play Store
   - They see "Internal test" badge
   - Updates are instant (no review)

**Time to users:** ~30 minutes

---

### Option B: Beta Testing (More Users)

**Best for:** Testing with more users before public release

1. Build production version
2. In Google Play Console:
   - Go to **Testing ‚Üí Closed testing**
   - Create track (e.g., "Beta")
   - Upload AAB
   - Add testers or create opt-in URL
   - Publish

**Time to users:** ~1-2 hours

---

### Option C: Production Release (All Users)

**Best for:** Final public release

1. Build production version
2. Submit to store:
```bash
eas submit -p android
```

3. In Google Play Console:
   - Go to **Production ‚Üí Releases**
   - Click "Create new release"
   - Upload AAB
   - Write release notes
   - Review and roll out

**Time to users:** 1-7 days (Google review)

---

## üì± Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OTA Limitations

**OTA Updates work for:**
- JavaScript code changes
- React component changes
- Business logic changes

**OTA Updates DON'T work for:**
- ‚ùå App icon changes (NATIVE)
- ‚ùå Notification configuration (NATIVE)
- ‚ùå Permission changes (NATIVE)
- ‚ùå Native module changes

### Why Your Changes Need Full Build:

Your 6 fixes include NATIVE changes:
1. Icon (native asset)
2. Notification icon (native config)
3. File permissions (native config)

**Therefore: You MUST create a full new build**

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Profiles Explained

Your `eas.json` should have:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "aab"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Profile
- Purpose: Testing on your devices
- Output: APK (easy install)
- Use: `eas build --profile development --platform android`

### Production Profile
- Purpose: Google Play Store
- Output: AAB (optimized)
- Use: `eas build --profile production --platform android`

## üîç Verifying Build Has Your Changes

### After Installing New Build:

1. **Check Version:**
   - Look for version in app (should be 1.0.1)
   - Or check in device settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Patient Management

2. **Check Icon:**
   - Home screen should show OnCare logo
   - Not the default Expo icon

3. **Test Features:**
   - All 6 fixes should work

### If Changes Still Not Visible:

1. **Uninstall old app completely**
```bash
adb uninstall com.oncare.patientmanagementapp
```

2. **Clear device cache** (optional)
   - Settings ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear cache

3. **Install new build**

4. **Restart device** (optional)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: "Icon not found"

**Problem:** Icon file doesn't exist

**Fix:**
```bash
curl -o assets/images/icon.png "https://www.oncarecancer.com/img/featured/2025-10-22%2C10%3A26%3A10.122Z-logo%20%283%29.png"
```

### Build Fails: "Google Services file not found"

**Problem:** Firebase config missing

**Fix:**
- Ensure `google-services.json` exists in project root
- Check `app.json` has correct path:
  ```json
  "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
  ```

### Build Succeeds But Changes Not Visible

**Problem:** Installed old build, not new one

**Fix:**
1. Check version number in app (should be 1.0.1)
2. If old version, uninstall and reinstall
3. Make sure you downloaded the LATEST build from EAS

### Duplicate Notifications Still Appear

**Problem:** Testing on Expo Go (not a real build)

**Fix:**
- Expo Go has limitations
- Must test on actual build (APK/AAB)
- Run `eas build --profile development`

### Download Not Working

**Problem:** Permissions not granted

**Fix:**
1. Check app permissions in device settings
2. Grant storage permissions
3. If still fails, rebuild with permissions in app.json ‚úÖ
