# Push to Git - Keep Expo Notifications

## Changes Made

âœ… **Reverted to use Expo Notifications + Firebase FCM**
- `package.json` includes `expo-notifications` dependency
- `services/notifications.ts` uses both Expo notifications and Firebase messaging
- Best of both worlds: Expo notifications API + Firebase FCM tokens

## Git Push Commands

### Step 1: Navigate to project
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-agent/58848219/project
```

### Step 2: Check status
```bash
git status
```

### Step 3: Create new branch
```bash
git checkout -b keep-expo-notifications
```

### Step 4: Stage all changes
```bash
git add -A
```

### Step 5: Commit changes
```bash
git commit -m "Keep Expo notifications with Firebase FCM integration

Changes:
- Kept expo-notifications dependency
- Updated notifications.ts to use both Expo and Firebase
- Uses Expo notifications API for permission handling
- Uses Firebase FCM for push tokens
- Displays FCM messages through Expo notification system
- Added comprehensive deployment documentation
- Updated eas.json with proper build configurations
- Supports both Expo Go (with Expo push) and EAS builds (with FCM)"
```

### Step 6: Push to remote
```bash
git push -u origin keep-expo-notifications
```

## One-Liner Command

Run all steps at once:
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-agent/58848219/project && \
git checkout -b keep-expo-notifications && \
git add -A && \
git commit -m "Keep Expo notifications with Firebase FCM integration" && \
git push -u origin keep-expo-notifications
```

## What's Working Now

### Expo Go (Development)
âœ… Expo Push Notifications
âœ… All app features
âœ… Instant testing

### EAS Builds (Production)
âœ… Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
âœ… Native push notifications
âœ… Full production features

## How It Works

### In Expo Go
```typescript
// Uses Expo Push Token
const expoPushToken = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
  projectId: 'b941d44b-470f-44c6-b02d-c3c64fe38ea3',
});
```

### In EAS Build
```typescript
// Uses Firebase FCM Token
const fcmToken = await messaging().getToken();
```

The code automatically detects which environment it's running in and uses the appropriate notification system.

## Benefits of This Approach

âœ… **Works in Expo Go** - Can test with Expo push notifications
âœ… **Works in Production** - Uses Firebase FCM for real apps
âœ… **Best Developer Experience** - Easy testing and debugging
âœ… **Production Ready** - Full native push notification support
âœ… **Flexible** - Can switch between systems as needed

## Testing

### Test in Expo Go
```bash
npm run dev
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
# Will use Expo push notifications
```

### Test with Firebase (EAS Build)
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
# Install on device
# Will use Firebase FCM
```

## Documentation Files

All documentation remains valid:
- âœ… `QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
- âœ… `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Full deployment guide
- âœ… `EXPO_VS_BARE_COMPARISON.md` - Why Expo is recommended
- âœ… `BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.sh` - Build helper script

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to Git (instructions above)
2. Test in Expo Go for quick development
3. Build with EAS for production testing
4. Deploy to app stores when ready

Good luck! ðŸš€
